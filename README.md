# Minesweeper

## Description

It's a minesweeper game, but in real life!

## Timeline

### During break: write a beta of the game.
### LOL NVM
* Store mine locations and player locations
* Show players approximately how far away the closest mine is; the farther that mine is, the more error in the approximation
* Let players "flag" certain coordinates as mined
* Might tell players whether or not a flag is accurate, but avoid trial and error
* If all mines have a nearby flag and no flags are far from mines, the players win!
* Stepping on a mine will make a player "out."  The player will still be able to see the coordinates of teammates and talk to them, though, so she can join another player.
* Players might have a map of the mined area, showing locations of players and flags.
* Voice chat?  Might take up a lot of bandwidth; could make players rely on other communications

### After break: peripheries-- user database, about and instruction pages, desktop/mobile interaction, etc
* A user database is a must!  Players should be able to log in and see games played, pending games, and things of that ilk.
* The user database could be extended to hold popular maps, common mined regions (Central Park, for example), and sharing stories.
* About and instruction pages are important too!  Might be one page.
* Desktop/mobile interaction-- one or several players might be "mission control--" they can see the map that might have been implemented above.  They would give the players their eye-in-the-sky, possibly balancing issues with too much information coming from the map.
* Versus mode?  Mine sweepers and mine planters

## A Brief Guide to Git

### Before Writing Code (this should be done already, I think)
1. Fork from the organization's repository into your own user account.
2. Create a branch.
3. Edit your branch's files while writing code.

### After Writing Code
1. Make sure everything works while still in your branch!
2. If all is good, merge your own branch with your repository's master branch...
3. Then submit a pull request to pull your repository's master branch into the organization's repository's master branch.
4. Other people should then pull from the organization's repository's master branch into their own master branches.
